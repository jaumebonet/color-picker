Color Picker
============

This is a simple javascript color picker aimed to the **RYG** color format;
basically done because we could not found one to do precisely what we needed.

The page is powered by [iro.js](https://github.com/jaames/iro.js), [rgb2ryb.js](https://github.com/bahamas10/node-rgb2ryb)
and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
